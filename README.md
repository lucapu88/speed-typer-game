Improves the speed in typing on a pc keyboard (also works on mobile).
The screen will show you random words and you will have to rewrite them, each word written correctly will give you a point. You can choose the difficulty (the harder it is, the longer the words) and the time (30 or60 seconds).
There is no backend in this project, so the score is saved locally and you will only see it on the device where you will play it.
